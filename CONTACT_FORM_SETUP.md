   ```javascript
   const notificationEmail = 'ninjatech5g@gmail.com'; // Update this to your business email
   ```

### Step 3: Deploy the Script

5. Click `Deploy`
6. **Copy the Web app URL** - you'll need this for the next step
7. Click `Done`

   ```javascript
   const GOOGLE_SCRIPT_URL = 'YOUR_GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL_HERE';
   ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Form Shows "Configure Google Apps Script URL" Error
- Make sure you replaced `YOUR_GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL_HERE` with your actual web app URL
- The URL should look like: `https://script.google.com/macros/s/[SCRIPT_ID]/exec`

### Submissions Not Appearing in Sheet
- Check that you deployed the script as a web app with "Anyone" access
- Verify the web app URL is correct in `contact.html`
- Check the Google Apps Script execution log for errors

### Emails Not Sending
- Gmail API might be disabled - go to Apps Script dashboard and enable Gmail API
- Check your Google account's email sending limits
- Verify email addresses are correct in the script

### Permission Errors
- Make sure you authorized the script when deploying
- The script needs permission to access Gmail and Google Sheets

## üîí Security Notes
- The script only accepts POST requests from your contact form
- All submissions are validated for required fields and email format
- No sensitive data should be collected through this form
- Consider adding CAPTCHA for additional spam protection

## üìû Support
If you encounter any issues with this setup:
- Check the Google Apps Script execution log for detailed error messages
- Ensure all permissions are granted when prompted
- Test with a simple form submission first
